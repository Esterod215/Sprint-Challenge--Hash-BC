1. A block chain are a list of blocks (which are collections of data)
-no cenral authority and each peer holds the collection of the chain
-data is almost impossible to be tampered with
How it works:
A transaction is made by a user with a unique key
the transaction is then validated using proofs then the block is added to the chain 
once validated
the block is now part of the ledger and is distributed to the network 
2. An array is a container that can hold a fixed amount of data

3. A has table is a data structurethat stores key/value pairs.It uses a hashing algorithm to hash
   to compute an index into an array in which an element can be inserted or searched
   A good hashing function wil allow for O(1) time searches and insertions
